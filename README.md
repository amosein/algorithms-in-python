# Algorithm in Python

Welcome to my personal repository where I implement various algorithms using Python.  
This project is part of my personal challenge to improve my coding skills and problem-solving approach.

I’m working through different algorithms — from basic to advanced — to better understand programming concepts, algorithmic thinking, and clean code practices.

### 📌 What You’ll Find Here

- 📖 Well-commented Python implementations
- 🧠 Algorithms from easy to complex
- 🔁 Continuous improvements as I grow

### 🚀 Why I’m Doing This

This is a self-study project. My main goals are:
- To challenge myself
- To practice and reinforce programming fundamentals
- To build a strong foundation for more advanced topics like data structures, competitive programming, and system design

### 💡 Notes

- This is a public repository intended mainly for my learning journey.
- If you find anything interesting, feel free to fork or suggest improvements.
- Contributions or feedback are welcome!

### 📂 Structure

Each folder or file contains:
- A clear algorithm implementation
- Inline comments for clarity
- Sometimes basic test cases or example usages
